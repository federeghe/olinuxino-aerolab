Today I successfully installed the official Debian Image into A20-OLinuXino's flash.

First, download and uncompress this file which contains the bootloader and an image of the flash partition scheme:

http://dtmh.de/files/olinuxino-a20-flashinstall.zip

After that, change into the folder which contains the uncompressed files.

Now, here is the quick recipe:

#############################################################################
# HOWTO install a running SD-card image to A20-OLinuXino NAND flash 
#
# The following steps must be executed as root and on a running SD-card image!
#
# Sunxi kernel 3.4.43 or later is required. 
# Tested with official Olimex Debian Wheezy image with kernel 3.4.61+
#
# The flash partition scheme will looks like follow:
# /dev/nanda is BOOT device
# /dev/nandc is ROOT device
# /dev/nandb is MAGIC device
#
#############################################################################

# First of all, make sure that all nand devices /dev/nand* are unmounted 
# (check output of mount if you are not sure)

# Copy A20 flash partition image to NAND flash
tar -xzOf nand_part.gz | dd of=/dev/nand
sync

# reboot to make new partitions available
reboot

# after reboot: create filesystems
mkfs.vfat /dev/nanda
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nandc
echo -e 'ANDROID!\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\c' > /dev/nandb

# mount new filesystems
mkdir /mnt/nanda
mkdir /mnt/nandc
mount /dev/nanda /mnt/nanda
mount /dev/nandc /mnt/nandc

# install bootloader to /dev/nanda
rm -rf /mnt/nanda/*
rsync -avc bootloader/* /mnt/nanda

# copy script.bin and uImage into new root device under /boot
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot
rsync -avc /boot/script.bin /boot/uImage /mnt/nandc/boot/

# if you need additional kernel arguments, you can create a uEnv.txt file under
# /mnt/nandc/boot/ wich contains the following line:
extraargs=<your extra kernel args here>

# copy rootfs
rsync -avc --exclude-from=exclude.txt / /mnt/nandc
sync

# shutdown and remove SD card
shutdown -h now

# now power on the device and it should boot from NAND!

Enjoy!
